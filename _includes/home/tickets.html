<p>Choose the <strong>Full-price ticket</strong> if your company is paying for you to attend or will be reimbursing you, or if you're able to pay the full-price. Part of your ticket price will help support women to attend this conference that cannot select this option.</p>
<p>Choose the <strong>Half-price ticket</strong> if youâ€™re a student, paying your own way, unemployed or transitioning between jobs. We have this ticket price to help keep the cost of this conference affordable for all women.<p>
<p class="small">Please note that all ticket sales are final after Sunday, November 15.</p>
