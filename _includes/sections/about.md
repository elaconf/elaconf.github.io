A safe, inclusive tech leadership conference and community for adult (18+) marginalized genders to connect with and empower one another.

Leadership skills are crucial to making an impact in the field and creating diversity in the workplace. Companies with greater top-level gender diversity perform better financially, are more empathetic, and more innovative. When marginalized individuals become leaders, the entire tech community benefits.

This is a 1.5 day event, spanning a Friday evening and full Saturday. All timeline announcements, such as CFP opening and ticket sales, will be published on our blog and newsletter.

*All attendees, speakers, volunteers, specials guests, and organizers are excepted to follow the Code of Conduct at all times.*
