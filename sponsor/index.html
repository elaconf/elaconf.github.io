<p>Ela is a conference and community with a goal to create a safe, supportive, inspiring and comfortable space for adult (18+) marginalized genders to gain the confidence needed to become leaders, speakers, writers, and teachers in the world of tech.</p>

<p>Ela Conf is simply not possible without your support. We aim to keep ticket costs low while also offering childcare stipends, financial and diversity grants, cover all meals, secure a centrally located venue, reimburse speaker travel and lodging, and host a networking party following the event. The spirit of the event focuses on providing a platform for new and experienced speakers to share their stories and knowledge.</p>

<p>We cannot wait to call you a partner in our mission.</p>
