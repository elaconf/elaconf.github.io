    <p>Last year our sponsors helped us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee breaks to keep us going.</li>
      <li>Host the event in a spacious, accessible, secure, and centrally-located building.</li>
      <li>Cover the ticket costs for women who would ordinarily be unable to attend.</li>
      <li>Connect women with new career opportunities and a support system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Your sponsorship can help make Ela Conf even better.</strong></p>
