    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Ela Conf is a conference with a goal to create a safe, supportive, inspiring and comfortable <em>community</em> for adult women (18+) to gain the confidence needed to become leaders, speakers, and teachers in the world of tech. All profits from this event will be donated to <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>.</p>
    <p>In an industry where women are so often marginalized, leadership skills are crucial to making an impact in the field and creating diversity in the workplace. Companies with greater top-level gender diversity perform better financially, are more empathetic, and more innovative. When women become leaders, the entire tech community benefits.
    </p>
