title: Accessibility details at Wharton

Huntsman Hall is entirely accessible by way of ramps, including presentation areas. This includes the parking area and main auditorium.

Bathrooms include grad bars, lowered sinks, and lowered urinals.

Three sets of unlocked elevators available during open building hours.

There are extra rooms we can set up as quiet rooms / green rooms, and regularly do when hosting an event.

While not ideal, there are not gender neutral bathrooms. There are gender neutral bathrooms at the Inn at Penn Hotel down the block, which we have access to.

This venue has provided private space for nursing mothers in the past (at [“Introduction to Python for Women and Their Friends”](http://www.meetup.com/phillypug/events/193735402), specifically).

We plan to be on a single floor for the event, so getting between classrooms across the “forum” is convenient.
