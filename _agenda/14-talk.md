I would not have started studying computer science if it hadn't been for my sister, and I would not have survived computer science let alone pursued a career in technology if it hadn't been for her and the many supportive female friends I had in my classes, student clubs, and research labs. This talk is about the importance of ladies supporting ladies and the positive impact of support and solidarity from those people closest to you. I'll be sharing my own experiences about how my family and friends have influenced my career path and confidence, whether that's by encouraging me to pitch talks to conferences or by discussing imposter syndrome over bubble tea.

Above all, I'll discuss:

* why you should also get yourself a squad
* how you can get yourself a squad
