Do you feel like you're too new to the tech world to start contributing and helping others? It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and like you’ll never learn enough to start participating in a more meaningful way. But there are many ways to give back and start to feel like a contributing member of your tech community, even as a beginner! I’ll touch on how to know when you’re ready, how to recognize what you know, and how to ease into giving back and sharing your knowledge. I still consider myself a beginner, but there are things I wish I had done while I was first starting out as a web developer, and I’d love to share them with you!
