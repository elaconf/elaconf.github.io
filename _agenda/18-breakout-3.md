The aim of this workshop is to guide attendees through a goal-setting process. A goal setting group was formed after the first Ela Conf, and has continued to provide a network of support for Ela Conf community members ever since.

In this workshop, we will open by providing context for the audience on the history of the Ela Conf goals group. The following topics will be covered first:
The benefits of a regular, supportive group of women meeting, sharing, and setting goals
Establishing and maintaining an open and understanding environment to participate in as participants work towards them.
