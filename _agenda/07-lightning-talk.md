My talk will be about how making inclusivity the ethos of a team or company or project, even, will ultimately lead to a better outcome and overall product. I’ll explore possible approaches to fostering a more inclusive future and how having inclusivity, simply for the sake of inclusivity, could yield a more insidious and dangerous outcome; no matter how unintended it may be. I’ll also give a real life example of my team, a wildly diverse team, that loudly lives our inclusivity mantra, which has permeated the discoveries we've made and the achievements we've reached as we work to bring our collaboration platform to life.
