We’ve all been at the negotiation table, whether we choose to participate or not. It’s easy to avoid this short lived discomfort, but doing so can cost the average person around $500,000 in lost income over the course of their lifetime.

And finally, I’ll discuss some cheeky psychological tricks to help boost your confidence and success.
