Being an “Origin Story” manager starts with hiring for emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills instead of “100% qualified on paper.” True potential can’t be discovered on paper. An "Origin Story" manager sees the potential in someone by assessing emotional intelligence, finding value, and hiring with the understanding that the new hire can bring an unforeseen value to the organization over time. An "Origin Story" manager needs to be comfortable creating an on boarding plan customized for each new employee’s needed areas of growth, effectiveness, and support. Allow someone to bring their true self to work without unrealistic expectations and watch them flourish under a management style that encourages others to feel comfortable with their origin and path within your organization.
