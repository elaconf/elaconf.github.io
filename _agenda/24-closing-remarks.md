How do you feel about taking up space?

If you're like many women, the idea of "taking up space" prompts a feeling of deep-seated unease. You don't wanna. You've been socialized to minimize yourself emotionally and physically. And you've become so good at it, you don't even realize you're doing it... or how far-reaching the consequences of this undermining behavior can be.

To close out Ela Conf, we'll identify a few of these behaviors and make a plan to overcome them. We'll depart ready to take up space and claim our place in tech: to ask for what we need, to take opportunities for advancement in our careers, to speak up fearlessly when we don't understand or agree, and so much more.
