Breaking into tech? N00b at 0’s and 1’s? Learning how to computers? We’ve all been there. Nobody started out knowing to code, design, or even type for that matter. In this talk, I’ll be sharing my story as a career changer and how I’ve embraced being a #Learner4Lyfe to land my dream job. Don’t let not knowing hold you back from pursuing your goals. Through my experience, I hope you too can learn how to become a skilled beginner, empower yourself through all of the mistakes, and celebrate even the small wins.
