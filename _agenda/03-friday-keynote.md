The role of a leader is multi-faceted---it includes motivating and coaching employees, controlling and directing resources, and making high visibility decisions. These responsibilities not only contribute to leadersâ€™ experiences with, and levels of, stress, but also hint at the magnitude of impact that leader stress may have on organizational vitality and employee well-being. Accordingly, I will share findings from management research and practice regarding three inter-related topics: (1) what sources of stress exist uniquely for leaders; (2) implications of leader stress management and coping for their employees and organizations, including to what extent does stress cascade in work settings; and (3) how to promote and nurture ourselves as leaders--in mind, body and spirit.
