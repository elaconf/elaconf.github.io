Alex is currently a user experience designer at Azavea and has worked as a frontend web developer in the past. A graduate of Tyler School of Art's Graphic and Interactive Design program, she has lived in Philadelphia for the past seven years. When not poking around the internet for inspiration, she's dreaming about travel, attempting to learn how to cook, playing lots of Ultimate frisbee, or doodling.
