Specifically, she explores the intersection of positive and negative leadership processes with topics of workplace mistreatment, stress and coping, and motivation. She is currently developing a portfolio of projects focused on understanding the range of stressors todayâ€™s leaders experience, as well as the implications for employees and organizational life of how their leaders cope with, and manage, their stress. She earned her Ph.D. in organizational behavior from the University of Maryland in 2011. Prior to Wharton, Payal served on the faculty at Rutgers Business School-Newark and New Brunswick. Her professional experience before entering academia included working at Harvard Business School in External Relations and for the U.S. Government Printing Office in Human Capital.
