After graduating from university Lucy moved to work in Silicon Valley where she learned Ruby on Rails. She transferred to their New Zealand office for a few months and then made the hop over to Sydney. When she first arrived she continued at a Rails shop and learned more OOP and better Rails-y structure. After that she's moved on to being a front end developer at Atlassian, working on the Bitbucket Server team. She is one of the organisers for the Women Who Code Sydney group, has helped organise the local chapter of Rails Girls, and has run a few programming related study groups.
