Louisa Frank is a retired Senior Vice President of Technology at Bank of America. After starting her career at the University of Delaware Plato Project, she went on to work in several major companies, progressing from software developer to manager, and finally technology executive. A few years ago, she retired early and revisited her programming roots, among other things, learning HTML and CSS, programming and maintaining a website for a non-profit firm, Water Is Life Kenya, and maintaining her own website, thisislafrank.com. Since then, she's reprogrammed her personal website several times, each time learning a new language and more skills and having fun doing it.
