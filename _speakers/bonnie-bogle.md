Bonnie works with companies to help them build strong internal systems that support their teams and inclusive, ambitious company cultures - and she sometimes writes about it. She's led operations at tech companies for 10+ years, most recently at Mapbox, which she co-founded, and before that at Development Seed. Bonnie recently moved back to Philly after a long run in DC, and spends her free time going on urban hikes, trying out the city's amazing restaurants, and running along the Schuylkill river.
