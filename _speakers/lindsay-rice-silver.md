Lindsay is a web developer at Wall-to-Wall Studios in Pittsburgh, PA.  Leaving college with a background in English, she began her adventures into the world wide web through the field of digital scholarship — creating websites which analyzed data drawn from rare Quaker manuscripts.  Discovering that web development was something she really enjoyed, Lindsay then expanded upon her knowledge of the web with a lot of help from GDI classes in Philly and Pittsburgh.  Lindsay continues to participate in the GDI community as an organizer, TA, Code & Coffee liason, student, and a teacher.  In her free time, Lindsay enjoys walking around Pittsburgh when it’s sunny, eating chocolate chip cookies, and watching the Great British Baking Show.
