Ruthie has been a Research Technologist at Jefferson University’s Kimmel Cancer Center since 2015. She works in translational pathology where she wields databases to determine candidates for clinical and research trials. 

When not wrangling a dataset or leveraging new tech, she’s indulging in Udacity classes and conferences. Ruthie is also a graduate student at Georgia Tech, studies code on the regional rail, and always runs into someone she knows at IKEA. Ruthie suspects her favorite part of studying is using and collecting stationery. She’ll sleep when she’s dead.
