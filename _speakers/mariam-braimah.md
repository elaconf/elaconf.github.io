Mariam is a former imposter syndrome patient turned full on product designer. After graduating from Harvard University with a degree in History of Art and Architecture, she took the "rational" next step of moving to San Francisco to  become a UI designer. Since arriving in the Bay Area she has had the opportunity to work on enterprise dashboards for a privacy/public data startup, creative direct an award winning brand campaign, and lead a Product Design team. In her spare time she DJs and attempts yoga poses (often with little success). <br>Mariam is currently on the Netflix Product Design team trying not to binge watch Narcos while at work.
