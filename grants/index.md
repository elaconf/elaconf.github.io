The Opportunity Grant allows potential attendees to apply to have their ticket cost fully covered based on either financial or diversity based factors. This grant does not cover any travel or lodging expenses. If you belong to a member of any especially under-represented group, we're particularly keen to have you at the event. We'd also dislike for the cost of a ticket to be a barrier for anyone to attend.

Ela Conf organizers will review all submissions and inform applicants of the final selection as soon as possible.

At any point should you have questions about the application, please email us at: [hello@elaconf.com](mailto:hello@elaconf.com)
