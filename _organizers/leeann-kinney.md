LeeAnn Kinney is a karaoke-loving, emoji-overusing front-end developer living in Philadelphia. She is a web accessibility advocate, chapter leader of Girl Develop It Philly, and co-organizer of LadyHacks, a community event for women that follows the model of a civic hackathon, with a goal of working on projects for the social good rather than hosting a competition. LeeAnn lives in South Philly with her partner Dan, her pup, Johnny and fat cat, Cutie. She loves spending time outdoors whenever she can, hiking, biking, camping, or floating in a lake or river.
