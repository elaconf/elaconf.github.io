Joni Trythall is a designer, author, occasional teacher, and all the time mom. Joni got started in tech because she wanted to bring her colorful illustrations to life on the screen and hasn’t looked back since. Years later she works to give back to the community that has taught and supported her so much. She lives at the tip top of Delaware and is known for making gluten free cookies that don’t taste gluten free.
