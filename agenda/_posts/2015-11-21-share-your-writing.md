title: Share Your Writing With Confidence
speakers:
- Marie Mosley
---

My talk is about sharing your technical writing with confidence. 

The idea of sharing your technical knowledge with the internet can be intimidating, especially if that knowledge is new or you're part of a marginalized group. I want to share some strategies I've developed that help me write well and keep negativity at bay.

What it will cover: 

* Giving yourself "permission" to write about tech
* Defining your audience
* Editing the shyness out of your writing
* Managing negative feedback


What it won't cover: the nuts and bolts of writing. Nothing about grammar, getting ideas, style guides, etc.

Who should attend: anyone who feels shy about writing about tech, or anyone who currently writes about tech but is having issues with "second-guessers".
