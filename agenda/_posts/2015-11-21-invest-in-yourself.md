To invest in yourself is to invest in others. In a world that is pre-occupied in getting ahead and contributing to a community, we often find ourselves at a critical breaking point when it is too often too late. We put time into cultivating our work, relationships with others, and our families, but what about investing time in ourselves? Focusing on self-care is not a once and done deal. It is something that needs to become part of your routine whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly. This talk will examine and share various ways to help avoid burnout and solutions on how to make self-care part of your regular routine.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Identifying what burnout feels like for you
* Holding yourself accountable for your self-care
* Giving yourself permission to take care of yourself
* Identifying ways in which you can prioritize and provide self-care
