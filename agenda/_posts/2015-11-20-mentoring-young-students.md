Every October, I get to mentor an amazing group of kids at the local middle school. These kids come together and learn how to design, build, and program robots. My daughter is one of these kids, and for her, I stepped out of my comfort zone and became a Vex robotics mentor 4 months after starting my first job in tech. At first, I thought “What am I going to teach these kids? I don’t know anything about building robots, or programming!” Throughout the course of my mentorship experience, I’ve learned that even if you don’t know anything about the subject material, showing up is the most important thing you can do. In this lightning talk, I’ll share with you some of the lessons that I’ve learned mentoring this amazing group of robotics engineers.
