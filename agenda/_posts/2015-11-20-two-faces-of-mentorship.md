I will be describing my most valuable mentor, someone who pushed me to be more than I can be and open doors for me in his own unique way. He also introduced me to ideas and people that helped build upon my experiences and interests and which led me to my current passion and career. I will also be describing another person who thought of herself as my mentor but whom I realized was the opposite of what a mentor should be. This in itself was a valuable experience and made me realize the difference between true mentorship and someone who you think fits that role solely by virtue of their position in life. 

This is a talk to help put things into perspective for anyone seeking out mentorship at the moment or is questioning who their mentors really are. Hopefully my experiences can shed some light on what mentorship truly means.
