Backwards design or understanding by design is a principle that has remarkable crossover between two seemingly disparate worlds: teaching and software engineering.  Once you explore the topic though, the connections become apparent.  How do I create [blank] so that it has the outcome I want?  Whether [blank] is a curriculum unit or a new app, focusing on your end result helps lend structure to your creative process.
