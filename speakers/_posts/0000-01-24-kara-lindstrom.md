With a background in how people and space influence each other, Kara currently serves as Enabler (Program Manager) for the Expressive & Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center at Drexel University. The Center is a hub for highly-multidisciplinary work at the intersection of design, technology and entrepreneurship. 
Her love for culture, transit, and Philadelphia has also led her to be involved as a co-organizer with both Urban Geek Drinks and the Philadelphia Geek Awards.

Two ongoing dream projects for Kara are:

- Making transit stations hubs for civic discourse through design and technology.
- Developing an education culture (pK-20) in which everyone feels they are contributors to the greater collective of human knowledge.
