Arti Jitendra Walker-Peddakotla is a Product Manager, scientist, technologist. Arti’s career trajectory spans from spending 6 years in the military, to working for 4 years on her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology (she opted for her Masters instead), to then deciding that what she really wanted to do was take a leap of faith and try her hand at something she’d never done before. So Arti started reading her husband’s network security books. Arti began to see correlations between cell signaling networks and computer networks, as well as similarities in how these networks and endpoints are protected. This study led to Arti securing her first job in the tech field as a product support analyst at a mobile security startup called NowSecure. During her time at NowSecure, Arti has worked with the support, services, and product teams, filling in for various roles that were needed at the company. Arti eventually worked her way up to become a Product Manager at NowSecure, where she supports the development and delivery of all NowSecure products.
