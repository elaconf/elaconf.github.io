Sarah Johnson started her IT career as a receptionist who asked why her company used pen and paper instead of a web application and ended up as the Manager of Technology. She learned web programming on the job with support from community tech user groups, eventually giving back to the same community by teaching with organizations like Girl Develop It and TechGirlz. After volunteering with TechGirlz as a teacher, committee member, and TechShopz Coach, Sarah was hired as the Community Outreach Manager, working to engage the community in and beyond Philadelphia to inspire girls to learn about technology.

Sarah's social life consists of organizing and attending technology-related events in the Philadelphia area. She is a co-organizer of OpenAccessPHL, a network of civic technology enthusiasts and innovators, a member of the planning committee for the Women in Tech Summit, and an active member of the Code for Philly brigade of Code for America.
