Adrienne Lowe is a former personal chef from Atlanta who documents her experience learning Python & teaching others to cook at Coding with Knives (http://codingwithkniv.es). Her project marries her lifelong passion for culinary arts with her new love, programming, and shows how these disparate subjects can inform one another in compelling ways. This year she's given talks at PyTennessee, DjangoCon Europe, and her local Python user groups PyATL and PyLadiesATL, which she co-organizes. In September she organized Atlanta's first Django Girls, where 24 women built their first web apps. In her spare time, she lends fundraising expertise to the Django Events Foundation of North America (DEFNA) and the Django Software Foundation.
