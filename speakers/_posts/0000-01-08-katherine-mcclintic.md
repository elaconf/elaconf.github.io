Katherine is a former history teacher turned software engineer.  She doesn't like to call herself a former or ex teacher in a general sense because she feels that no matter her career, it will involve teaching in some way.  She is a proud native of Washington, DC and loves to complain about her city's continually disappointing sports teams.
