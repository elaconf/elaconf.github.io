Claire is a self-starter. She taught herself how to row then got an athletic scholarship to UNC-Chapel Hill. After graduating, she moved to Philadelphia and started Rittenhouse Magazine, a printed lifestyle publication which had a run of 4 years and monthly readership of 125k. She taught herself how to code then launched a non-profit website, MySeason.org, to help those who are 50+ find jobs. She started Home Runner in the Spring of 2015 to combat inefficiencies of the home repair industry. With Home Runner, Claire manages a team of three and also coded the front and backend as well as the corresponding iOS app.

Claire lives in Philadelphia with her husband, two year old son and a second baby, due in March. She is an avid marathon runner, beekeeper and LP collector.
