## Potential CFP Topics

We've created a list of potential topics that you can present at Ela Conf. This list is certainly not exhaustive; we'd love to hear what you have to say.

### Discovering And Embracing Your Limitations

In our quest to conquer everything that comes in our way, we sometimes don’t honor the fact that there are truly some things that limit us from maybe achieving those dreams we’ve held for so long. The realization that this is okay, that we can’t all be rockstars at everything we try and do, and the freedom that can come from that is important to talk about.

### Talking, Mentoring, Writing

The best way to amplify your voice, and push for the equality of women in tech is to publish your writing, to submit CFPs, talk at conferences, and always reach behind you and help the next generation of women in tech. But how can you do this if you just started your career in tech? We know that as a beginner in tech, it can seem daunting to share your voice and knowledge, so if you've already started doing this, how did you get started? How did you present the information, and how has this helped you grow your career? How did you know which CFPs to apply for? How did you prepare for your talk, and overcome any stage fright? How did you start the mentorship process and what organizations do you work with?

### Raises, Promotions, And Salaries

It’s well known that women get paid, on average 79 cents for every dollar earned by men[^1], so what we can do to make sure we’re taking charge of our salaries? How have you pushed for and negotiated promotions, raises or starting salaries? Was there a specific technique you used to give yourself the confidence to ask for a specific amount or title? This is topic where if you’re willing to share your story, you will help someone in the audience ask for that raise or promotion.

### Gaining That Confidence When You’re Just Starting Out

The tech industry can be especially intimidating and difficult to break into. What sort of obstacles have you had to overcome? What does your educational path look like? What was your first job or what would you like your first job to look like? How did you find your voice, and the strength to speak up and use it? The story around how you got started and the struggles you went through can often be an inspiration to others in similar situations.

### Building The Most Important Brand: You!

When it comes to self-promotion, it’s sometimes harder for women to gather the courage needed to build a website, put their information out there for the world to see, and navigate the internet world. So how did you do it? What tools did you use to start publishing your writing, creating your online portfolio, ignoring any negative comments, and push the release button?

### Navigating Toxic Workplace Culture

Ever find yourself in a situation where someone says something inappropriate/offensive at work and you feel like you have to laugh it off because you are outnumbered or in a position of subordination? How do we gain the confidence needed to speak out against these injustices without feeling that our job is a risk? How do we survive a toxic work culture while also working to replace this same culture with one of empathy and respect?
