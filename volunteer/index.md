All Ela Conf volunteers will receive a ticket to the event at no cost. Positions are limited, so please sign up below as soon as possible!

## Speaker Mentors
We are looking for experienced women mentors to help first-time speakers prepare for their presentations and panels! The time commitment here will vary, but likely involve two half-hour meetings with your mentee (so 1-2 hours total); which also doesn’t have to be in person (we love Hangouts too!).

## Promoter/Recruiter
Conference promoters are all about spreading the Ela word in Philly and beyond. We need to make sure that all the amazing women in tech know about Ela Conf. You’ll take to Twitter, drop into area meetups, or send emails to local organizations to help spread the word. Also, we’ll need you to live tweet pictures and thanks to our sponsors during the events themselves.

## Photography and/or Videographer
We are looking to team up with a local photographer and videographer to help capture the event. A photographer is needed to take photographs during the event but also to take participant headshots.

## Catering Coordinator
We’ll be ordering the food for the event, but we’ll still need some help in organizing the food tables, and directing conference attendees to the tables (volunteers will also help ensure that food is only taken by Ela Conf attendees).

## Time Keeper

We're looking for time keepers to help keep the conference moving. You'll hold up cards to let speakers know how much time they have left and help us round up attendees after breaks to let them know the next session is starting.
