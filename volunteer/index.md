If you are interested in volunteering for Ela Conf please [complete this very brief form](http://goo.gl/forms/gw7UQHYHxY) and we’ll be in touch!

Volunteer tickets will be offered free of charge!

## Speaker Mentors
We are looking for experienced women mentors to help first time speakers prepare for their presentations and panels! The time commitment here will vary, but likely involve two half hour meetings with your mentee (so 1-2 hours total); which also doesn’t have to be in person (we love Hangouts too!).

## Panel Moderators
There will be a number of panels during the conference and moderators are needed to lead these panels by introducing panel participants, asking a set of established questions, and keeping the group on track.

## Promoter/Recruiter
Conference promoters are all about spreading the Ela word in Philly and beyond. We need to make sure that all the amazing women in tech know about Ela Conf. You’ll take to Twitter, drop into area meetups, or send emails to local organizations to help spread the word. Also, we’ll need you to live tweet pictures and thanks to our sponsors during the events themselves.

## Event Check-In Table (Registration)
We need a friendly someone to assist with the check-in process for both the Friday meet and greet and the event on Saturday. This role is especially important because you are the very first person attendees will interact with when they arrive.

## Photography/Videographer
We are looking to team up with a local photographer and videographer to help capture the event. A photographer is needed to take photographs during the event but also to take participant headshots.

## Live Sketch Notes
Last year, we had an amazing opportunity where some designers drew sketch notes of some of the panel discussions and talks. We’d love once again to have this at this year’s conference, with the goal of putting the prints up for sale to fund future Ela Conf’s. Contact us if you’re interested!

## Catering Coordinator
We’ll be ordering the food for the event, but we’ll still need some help in organizing the food tables, and directing conference attendees to the tables (volunteers will also help ensure that food is only taken by Ela Conf attendees).
