## Photography and/or Videographer
We are looking to team up with a local photographer and videographer to help capture the event. A photographer is needed to take photographs during the event but also to take participant headshots.

## Catering Coordinator
We’ll be ordering the food for the event, but we’ll still need some help in organizing the food tables, and directing conference attendees to the tables (volunteers will also help ensure that food is only taken by Ela Conf attendees).

## Time Keeper

We're looking for time keepers to help keep the conference moving. You'll hold up cards to let speakers know how much time they have left and help us round up attendees after breaks to let them know the next session is starting.
