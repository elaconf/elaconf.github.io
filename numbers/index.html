<p>Ela Conf is run by a community of <a href="/#organizers">organizers</a> and <a href="/2016/#volunteers">volunteers</a> who all donate their time and resources to the event year round. We collected numbers and stats from our <a href="http://elaconf.com/2015/">2015</a> and <a href="http://elaconf.com/2016/">2016</a> events and started collecting this year's data to share our growth, how we allocated funds, and a closer look into what goes into Ela Conf.</p>

<p>After Ela Conf 2015, we donated all profits to Girl Develop It. We didn't plan financially for 2016, which meant we started with $0 again. As a result, we've decided to put the profit toward seed money for Ela Conf 2017. This seed money means that we have a little more independence and flexibility in booking a venue and getting the planning process started. We hope to make 2017 even bigger and to make a sizable donation to Girl Develop It once again.</p>
