After attending Ela Conf 2015, a group of attendees had the idea of a goal squad to help each other stay accountable for their personal and professional goals. They had their first meeting in December and have been meeting monthly every since. They have their monthly meetings over Google Hangouts, have an in-person potluck quarterly, and use a Trello board to help keep track of goals.

Since joining the group, many of the members gotten new jobs, read empowering books, asked for raises or promotions, started or finished school, and given their first talks.

The group has grown from 5 active members to 15 after Ela Conf 2016!

We are so proud of this amazing squad! :purple_heart:
