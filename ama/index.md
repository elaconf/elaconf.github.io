We‚Äôll be hosting a monthly ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù series in our Slack channel, #ama. These sessions will take place on designated weekdays either around 12PM EST or 6:30PM EST and last up to one hour, depending on the guest‚Äôs schedule.

Our goal here to to provide designated time to seek advice and support from peers related to work, communication, community, and technology. Everyone has a unique story and perspective to share and getting to know one another better can be educational and go a long way in feeling truly part of something. Through our mission we are dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive space for women in tech to learn from and empower one another and part of that is providing a platform to ask questions.

We also envision this being a great opportunity to speak directly with employees of tech companies that are looking to hire, gaining valuable insider knowledge and preferences.

All guests this year will receive a complimentary ticket to Ela Conf 2017 ü§ó

## How it Works

Guests will receive an invite to the Slack channel prior to the start of the #ama, along with a list of community generated questions collected from #ama-questions. Guests are asked to send along a short bio to organizers sharing their background and mentioning any specific work or projects they would be especially excited to talk about right now.  

Each session will begin with an introduction and shared bio on behalf of the organizers, followed by the guest answering chosen, relevant questions until the designated end time. Due to the absence of threaded discussions, we ask that guests try to copy the question they are responding to and include it in their response to better help participants track the conversation, at which point participants are free to ask any follow up questions.

*Please note that #ama questions and responses may be published after the event but the identity of those asking questions will always be withheld.*
