We‚Äôll be hosting a monthly ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù series in our Slack channel, #ama. These sessions will take place on designated weekdays either around 12PM EST or 6:30PM EST and last up to one hour, depending on the guest‚Äôs schedule.

Our goal here to to provide designated time to seek advice and support from peers related to work, communication, community, and technology. Everyone has a unique story and perspective to share and getting to know one another better can be educational and go a long way in feeling truly part of something. Through our mission we are dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive space for women in tech to learn from and empower one another and part of that is providing a platform to ask questions.

We also envision this being a great opportunity to speak directly with employees of tech companies that are looking to hire, gaining valuable insider knowledge and preferences.

All guests this year will receive a complimentary ticket to Ela Conf 2017 ü§ó

## How it Works

Guests will receive an invite to the Slack channel prior to the start of the #ama. Guests are asked to send along a short bio to organizers sharing their background and mentioning any specific work or projects they would be especially excited to talk about right now. Bios will be shared in #general in the time leading up to the event and used to promote the ama on Twitter.¬†

Each session will begin with an introduction and shared bio on behalf of the organizers, followed by the start of participant questions. Guests will choose and answer questions until the established end time, though it may not be possible to touch on every submitted question. Following a [threaded discussion format](https://slackhq.com/threaded-messaging-comes-to-slack-417ffba054bd#.t88f3budk), participants are free to ask any follow-up questions they may have as well.

If as a participant you find yourself unable to attend a scheduled #ama and have questions for a specific guest, please feel free to post these in #ama-questions and we will submit them during the event for you.

*Please note that #ama questions and responses may be published after the event but the identity of those asking questions will always be withheld.*
