Our very first ELA Conf happened on November 20 and 21, 2015 at Huntsman Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On Friday night we hosted a meet and greet with scheduled lightning talks and then opened the floor to anyone who wanted to speak.

Saturday's day-long event featured 8 main stage talks and 2 break-out sessions with 3 workshops, panels, or talks each. We concluded Saturday with a networking event.

Overall, we had 97 attendees including 26 speakers, 12 sponsors, 4 volunteers, and 4 organizers.
